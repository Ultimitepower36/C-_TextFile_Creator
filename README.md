# Overview

This software called the Text File Crafter, is a program created to make and edit text files.
While this in of itself is not very impressive, the fact that it is written in C++ is. C++ is
not generally utilized for this type of thing, however some out-of-the-box thinking has lead
to the creation of the program you see before you.

The reason this software was created was done as a self imposed challenge, to learn a new coding
language and preform a task within it in a short time span. I would say I have succeeded in 
that regard.

# Development Environment

For this project, Visual Studio Code and it's various extentions made this project possible. I had
to do some creative problem solving in order to work around some kinks in the system. In the end, it
all came together.

The coding language for this project is C++ and its extentions included the if, io, and s stream systems.
These systems are coding bases that allow for files to be edited and read to the program. Without them
this software would be a lot larger.

# Future Work

Some possible future adjustments that could be made include:

- Better UI and exicution.
- Giving the software its own program outside of VSCode.
- Making the program more streamlines and usefull.
- Allowing for more functions and detailed edits for text files, and possibly other types of files.
